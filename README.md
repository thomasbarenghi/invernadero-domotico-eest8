# Domotic Greenhouse

During my last year in electronics, I led a team of 5 people to develop a home automation greenhouse with Arduino and C. The greenhouse had advanced capabilities such as automatically watering the plants, activating the ventilation, increasing the temperature thanks to a resistance and keep the temperature. In addition, we created an ecosystem in which plants grew in a healthy and sustainable way. We use the Blynk platform to connect the greenhouse to the internet and send information in real time to the client. This project allowed us to apply our theoretical and practical knowledge, improve our teamwork and leadership skills, and demonstrate our ability to create innovative solutions.
